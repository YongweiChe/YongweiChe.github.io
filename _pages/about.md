I'm a senior at Princeton University studying Computer Science. Iâ€™m fortunate to be advised by [Ben Eysenbach](https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/) and [Huacheng Yu](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~hy2/). After graduation, I'll be joining Radix Trading as a Quantitative Technologist.

My main interests are in reinforcement learning, low-latency systems, and systems for ML. I also enjoy analysis, mathematical game theory, and other random endeavors on the side :)

You can reach me at `X@princeton.edu` where `X := yongweic`.
